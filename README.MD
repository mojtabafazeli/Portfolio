## Portfolio
In this project I created my whole portfolio in multiple pages using css and java script. 

## How I design it
I created 5 pages: 
Home which provides an overall picture of my portfolio.
Work: which give some examples of my works.
About: where I talk about my self and my skills
Services: here I present the services that I can provide based on my knowledge and skills
Contact: my customers can use this page to contact me.

In the footer, I also provides a link to the contact page to provide an easier way for cutomers to reach me. I also added my 4 social media profiles address in facebook, linkedin, instagram and pinterest for customers to be in touch with me and get a better picture of my skills and knowlodge and an easier way to be in touch with me. 

## Design pattern
I used my logo above the page in the middle, without using any header; because the logo already contains my name. 
I also set the decoration style of the navigatino to none, as I would rather have the text in black color to  match with my color pallette. Though to make it clear which item is hovered over, I made it in a way to chane to a different color. 
I use accessbility elements wherever needed for those who have some disablilities to navigate easily through my portfolio. 

## What I learned
I learned how to mix for loop with addEventListener in an effective way and how to change the elements sytles from Javascript.
